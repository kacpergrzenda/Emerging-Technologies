## About The Project

The Software industry is rapidly changing and moving forward, with new software and technology coming out constantly that can be used to improve research and workflow. The purpose of this repository is to showcase how to utilise new technologies (Docker, Python & Jupyter Notebook) to visualize and analyse data on any machine by using containers, this helps get rid of the problem of software incompatibility.

## Technologies Used

* Python (Algorithms used, scikit-learn)
* Jupyter Lab (Jupyter notebooks)
* Docker (containers, images, docker commands)

## Getting Started

1. Open a directory on your machine and in the command line of this directory Git Clone this GitHub repository.

    ```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/kacpergrzenda/emerging-technologies 
    ```
2. Build the Docker container.
    ```bash
    $ docker-compose up
    ```
3. Access the server in a browser using this URL (If this URL does now work please view the URLs Docker has provided in the command line).
    ``` 
    http://127.0.0.1:8888/lab 
    ```
4. Once finished viewing/changing the files, Stop the Docker container.
    ```bash
    $ docker-compose down
    ```
