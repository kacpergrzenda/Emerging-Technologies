    "Quantum computers are machines that use properties of quantum physics to store data and perform computations. Quantum computers use qubits as a basic unit of memory, these bits have the same restrictions as normal bits do, they can store only a single binary piece of information and can only ever give an output of 0 or 1. They can extremely outperform classical computers and have massive advantages for certain tasks where they could vastly outperform even our best supercomputers.\n",
    "For example, if you entangle qubits, you can solve problems that classical computers cannot. For example, crack any common security system such as 128-bits AES encryption in seconds, where a supercomputer today would take millions of years to do the same job."

    "Quantum computers use qubits, the qubits can be 0 and 1 (any two states) at the same time, it is this that gives the quantum computer its superpower. Qubit can be anything that exhibits quantum behaviour electron, photon, or nucleus. For example, in a magnetic field an electron can be in two states spin up spin down which can be addressed as 1 or 0. Quantum objects can be in both states at the same time, when you measure the spin, it’ll be spin up or spin down. And once it measured the other information is lost, but before you measure it, the electron can exist in a Quantum Super Position. This is what makes Quantum Computers fast as they can perform calculations as they can use these quantum super positions available to them with the qubits."

A classical computer uses normal logic gates (AND, OR & NOT), it takes a simple set of inputs and produces one output. Quantum gates manipulates an input using quantum superpositions to pick the correct answer. For example, when it comes to solving a maze, a Classical Computer will test each path one at a time until it finds the exit. A Quantum Computer can solve the maze in one go because the state of the qubit will keep changing to solve the maze until it exits the maze.\n",
